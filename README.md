## PyQMC

A python module that implements real-space quantum Monte Carlo techniques. It is primarily meant to interoperate with PySCF. Documentation is available at [readthedocs](https://pyqmc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

The code is currently in an early state, so there may be bugs and missing features.
